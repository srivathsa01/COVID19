# COVID-19 Dataset Sample Analysis
Sourced from https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data.
This analysis was conducted for my university assignment.

1. Design.pdf is an ER Diagram that highlights relations between the selected csv files. (Some files were consolidated as one entity, each csv is not specifically one entity).
2. Database.sql is a script query that designs the database tables for use in SQLite.
3. Vaccinations.db is the resulting database.
4. Queries.sql are the script queries run to answer the questions given in the assignment, they are basic explorational queries.
5. QueryResults.pdf is a snapshot of the results from these queries.
